Task: CLOUD STORAGE SETUP

This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of cloud storage using AWS S3, ensuring secure and scalable storage for data. The task includes creating an S3 bucket, configuring access permissions, and managing stored objects through AWS services. It provides a hands-on understanding of AWS S3 for cloud-based storage solutions.

### **Task Highlights**

1. **Cloud Storage Setup**
   - Created an Amazon S3 bucket for storing and managing files in the cloud.
   - Configured bucket settings, including:
          Bucket Versioning: Enabled to track and retain changes to stored objects.
          Access Policies: Implemented custom bucket policies to manage permissions.
          Encryption: Configured server-side encryption to secure data at rest.

2. **Data Upload and Retrieval**:
   -  Uploaded sample files (e.g., text files, images) to the S3 bucket.
   -  Validated object storage and retrieval using the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI.
   -  Confirmed proper functioning by accessing files via pre-signed URLs.

  
3. **Access Control**:
   - Implemented IAM Roles and Policies to restrict access to the bucket.
   - Utilized S3 Block Public Access to enhance security for sensitive data.
   - Configured permissions for authorized users to upload and download files.
  
4. **Lifecycle Policies**:
   - Created lifecycle rules to automate data management by transitioning objects to S3 Glacier for cost optimization.
   - Set up automatic deletion policies for obsolete files after a specific period.
  
5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Enabled S3 Server Access Logs to track bucket activity and access patterns.
   - Configured CloudWatch Metrics to monitor storage usage and requests.

6. **Cost Optimization**:
    - Analyzed storage usage with S3 Storage Class Analysis.
    - Transitioned infrequently accessed objects to S3 Intelligent-Tiering for cost savings.

### **Key Achievements**

1.  **Efficient Cloud Storage Implementation**:
    - Designed and implemented a scalable and secure storage solution using AWS S3.
    - Ensured data integrity and accessibility with bucket versioning and encryption.

2.  **Secure and Managed Access**:
     - Utilized IAM roles and bucket policies to ensure proper access control.
     - Enhanced data security by enabling block public access and configuring permissions.
  
3.  **Automated Data Management**:
     - Streamlined storage operations using lifecycle rules to reduce manual effort.
     - Optimized costs by transitioning data to lower-cost storage classes.
  
4.  **Enhanced Practical Knowledge of AWS**:
     - Gained hands-on experience with AWS S3, IAM, and CloudWatch for managing cloud storage.
     - Learned to deploy, manage, and monitor a robust cloud storage system effectively.

5.  **Documented Workflow for Replication**:
     - Created a detailed documentation process, enabling easy replication of the cloud storage setup for future projects.
